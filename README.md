My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

Hello this is my test task for the courses Binary Studio Winter Academy :snowflake:
A little about me, my name is Denusiyk Yaroslav, I am a 3rd year student of the  [Kyiv Polytechnic Institute named after Igor Sikorsky](https://kpi.ua/ "Link to website") :mortar_board:

I created a resume for the character [Ryu](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%A0%D1%8E "Link to information about Ryu") because as a child when I played this game I didn't even think about how big their universe is. And after reading the information about him wanted to know more))




Well, I hope my resume [Ryu]( https://littleproger.github.io/homepage/  "Link to resume Ryu") will be interesting for you :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
